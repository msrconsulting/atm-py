This repo is currently under heavy revision in preparation for actual publication.  Issues that we will be investigating are:

* Package and repository structure
* Unit testing for entertaining pull requests
* Continuous integration for managing the code

It is not advisable to fork this repository until the structure is hardened.  At that time, this readme will be replaced.
